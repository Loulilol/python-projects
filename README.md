## Guess the word

A first version of a simple command-line version of the popular Wordle game built with Python. The player has a limited number of turns to guess a randomly selected word, with feedback provided on correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters after each guess. The game uses a file as a word bank, which can be easily updated to add more words.
